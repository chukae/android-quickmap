QuickMap is a small utility program I wrote for a friend, who complained that there were too many clicks between the contact list and getting directions to that person's house.  This app will open up the contacts app with a chooser for directions, which will then direct the user to the Google Maps app.

This code is totally open for use by anyone, mostly because it's incredibly simple.
